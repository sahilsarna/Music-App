# Music-App
Sarna's Jukebox
This is a personalized music player I developed with the help from a video tutorial by The Swift Guy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqhDI4BzO4U). The music player he make's is very basic, so I've added more functionality and provided better UI for the music player.

Functionality Additions:
1) Next and Prev buttons now allow to loop through the songs, instead of stopping at the last or first song, respectively. 
2) Music can now be played in the background when you close the App, allowing you to do other stuff on your phone and not being stuck in the app.
3) The song list is now sorted alphabetically.

UI Additions:
1) Updated the Status bar and Tab bar to have the same color as the App for a better user experience.
2) Added a header tab for the App Name.
3) Added a tab which lists the number of songs in the app at the end of the list. 
4) Added colors to make the app uniform.
